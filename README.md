# Attacks And Countermeasures
The Attacks and Countermeasures textbook prescribes hands-on learning through practical lab work that can be accomplished on most laptop or desktop computers. Each chapter is designed around these labs based on common cybersecurity subdisciplines. Some of these subdiscipline topics cover multiple chapters and not all cybersecurity disciplines are included in this textbook. The chapters introduce the fundamentals of the cybersecurity subdiscipline, alongside activities and exercises to practice the topic.  
  
Upon reading this textbook and performing exercises, the reader will have a strong introduction and understanding on how cybersecurity affects organizations and technologies. Readers will develop research and critical thinking skills that support applying cybersecurity principles to new or existing technologies. It is the hope that many will be inspired to work in cybersecurity or enhance their information technology careers by applying security principles in their respective careers.

## Purchase A Physical Copy
Buying a physical copy nets me about $4 in profit (enough for a cup of coffee).  The remaining price is Amazon's cut, printing costs, and shipping.  I did not write this textbook for profit and plan to have it available for free download in this GitHub repo.  But if you want a physical copy, you can purchase it from Amazon at this link: [Attacks and Countermeasures: Hammon, Daniel: 9798317036737: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Attacks-Countermeasures-Daniel-Hammon/dp/B0FCG822N3/) https://www.amazon.com/Attacks-Countermeasures-Daniel-Hammon/dp/B0FCG822N3/

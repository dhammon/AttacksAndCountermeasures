# Appendix 1 - Continued Learning
In this appendix, I share some of the resources where interested readers can continue their exploration and learning within the cybersecurity field.  The security community has its arms wide open to anyone that has an interest in learning new things.  I have direct experience with most of the items on this list or have reasonable confidence in their quality.  It is not comprehensive and there are many more great resources out there worthy of learning from.
## Local Groups
Building community and meeting new cybersecurity professionals will expose you to new ideas and opportunities.  I have found and helped others find job opportunities from local security groups.  I have also learned so much from presentations and discussions while attending meetings.  They usually have in-person monthly meetings and might have a small annual membership fees.  Often, vendors will sponsor the meeting offering swag, food, or activities while also demonstrating their product.  The following national level groups likely have a chapter near you.

**Information Systems Security Association (ISSA)** - Members get discounts on certifications, training help, and network opportunities.  https://www.issa.org

**International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC2)** - While primarily a very reputable cybersecurity certification body, they also have local chapters with wide membership.  https://www.isc2.org

**Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA)** - Focused on networking around certifications, ISACA is a popular network with membership exclusives.  https://www.isaca.org

**Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)** - Mentioned several times throughout the textbook, OWASP has local chapters with meetups for application security centered professionals.  https://owasp.org
## Learning Sites
If you enjoyed the practical labs throughout the textbook, you may find the following free online resources particularly interesting.  Each has online labs and community support for practicing technical security concepts in a fun and interactive manner.  These free resources will dramatically improve your technical skills and expose you to tools and techniques used in trade craft.

**Hack the Box (HTB)** - Provides trainings, games, and capture the flag style boot to root boxes to learn and practice on.  https://www.hackthebox.com

**Try Hack Me (THM)** - Similar to HTB, but a more beginner friendly approach.  They cover many security topics and have a nice library of challenges and boxes to learn on.  https://tryhackme.com

**PortSwigger Academy** - The free online academy focuses on web application vulnerabilities and attacks through the use of the Burp Suite proxy tool.  Fun and awesome!  https://portswigger.net
## YouTube
YouTube is a great resource of write ups, tutorials, and demonstrations by a long list of talented people.  The following is a list of some of the highest quality and interesting channels I subscribe to.

**IppSec** - By far, the most influential channel where I have learned the most.  IppSec releases videos every week on retired HTB boxes providing the community official solution walkthroughs.  IppSec is beyond talented and demonstrates rich approaches, deep technical background, and clever insights for every box.  https://www.youtube.com/@ippsec

**DEFCONConference** - Each year, security researchers present relevant and cutting edge security topics in a wide range of areas at the annual Las Vegas conference DEF CON.  For those meetings that are recorded, DEF CON posts them on their official channel.  https://www.youtube.com/@DEFCONConference

**Matt Brown** - A relatively new channel on hardware hacking.  Matt demonstrates hardware breakdowns and hacking techniques in high quality with clear delivery.  https://www.youtube.com/@mattbrwn

**Nathan Baggs** - I'm not much of a gamer, but I love Nathan's fun reverse engineering walk throughs on old PC games.  They present distinct challenges and Nathan shares his thought process on what does and does not work. https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Nathan+Baggs

**DeviantOllam** - Deviant has several video presentations and demonstrations on that cover the physical penetration test space.  https://www.youtube.com/@DeviantOllam

**The Cyber Mentor** - Its been fun watching TCM grow over the years from just a YouTube channel, into a penetration testing firm, and now a certification body.  TCM offers great career advice and how-to videos.  https://www.youtube.com/@TCMSecurityAcademy

**13Cubed** - High quality digital forensics video content.  They also sell coursework which I can't attest to but would anticipate is likely amazing.  https://www.youtube.com/@13Cubed

**OALabs** - Another high quality channel dedicated on malware analysis.  They always have so much fun in the videos and are full of rich techniques and tips. https://www.youtube.com/@OALABS

**John Hammond** - I've been watching John for years since he started posting videos about hacking.  He produces high energy and exciting technical content in a very human way.  I love John's modesty and open nature exploring new techniques and tricks.  https://www.youtube.com/@_JohnHammond

>[!tip] Tip - 2x speed
>Watching videos on 2x the speed enables you to consume twice as much content.  It takes a little getting used to, but worth it.
## Podcasts
I try to maximize my time and listen to podcasts on commutes, walks, or doing other light focused activity.  Here are the security related podcasts I listen to on a regular basis.

**Darknet Diaries** - Jack Rhysider has a new drop every month where he investigates amazing stories from the internet usually centered around the cybersecurity space.  High production value and awesome story telling.  https://open.spotify.com/show/4XPl3uEEL9hvqMkoZrzbx5

**Security Now** - Steve Gibson's production through TWiT network has a weekly podcast where they cover interesting and relevant security news topics and technical deep dives.  https://open.spotify.com/show/7vAbYigR3zs8GYJP3EoVWw

**Hacked** - They took a long break but came back with really great stories and interviews in this monthly podcast.  https://open.spotify.com/show/21zZfOy7VCSIIWlJ64DElv
## Reddit
I like subreddits as the moderated content keeps unrelated topics from diluting quality content.  I know many security peers rely on X.com for up to date events, but I have too hard of a time refining the content to just security events and can't filter out unrelated social and political topics which I don't have much use for.  Therefore, I lurk on a couple subreddits a few times a day to get the targeted content I'm looking for.

**r/netsec** - High quality technical cybersecurity events, articles, and breakdowns.  Almost an overwhelming amount of the richest content out there.  https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/?rdt=35033

**r/cybersecurity** - There are some gems in there, but if you are looking for beginner level content, the cybersecurity subreddit is a great resource.  Generally focuses on questions and experiences of people getting into the field.  https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/
## Newsletters
To stay up to date on new tools and news, I also subscribe to weekly email newsletters.  I've made it a weekly habit to comb through them and find interesting topics to explore further.

**tl;dr sec** - Really great for new projects, tools, and write ups on a range of topics.  Can't recommend this one enough.  https://tldrsec.com/

**Unsupervised Learning** - Daniel Miessler is a pillar in the security community that has had a long history of contributions to the field with his SecLists project, career advice, and most recently interest in AI.  I like his newsletter as a curated summary of interesting weekly security news.  https://danielmiessler.com/
## Certifications
A great way to structure and demonstrate your learning is through certifications.  Not only do you learn a ton, but getting a certification is significant fodder on a resume.  I think almost any certification is worth it; however, some certifications are better than others.  Some are more recognized by employers while others are more rich in content or quality.  There are hundreds of security related certifications out there and I could recommend many of them.  

 >[!info] Info - Which cert should I get?
 I'm often asked which certs someone should focus on.  This is a personal question that I won't be able to answer here as it depends on an individual's circumstance like where they are in the career, where they want to go, interests, aptitude, timing and other factors.  But I often recommend CompTIA's Security+ for beginners.

Some certifications require annual membership fees and/or continuing professional education (CPE) credits.  CPEs might require you to do dozens of hours of professional training or contributions every year and then prove it.  This is usually pretty easy if you are passionate about the field and really becomes an exercise in taking inventory of your accomplishments over time.

Traditional certifications are multiple choice exams where you might do a course or read a book and then take a written test.  For example, when I completed the AWS Security Specialty certification I had to take an hours long multiple choice exam in a proctored testing center.  Other certifications are practical where instead of a multiple choice question answer exam, you have to demonstrate your skills and apply what you learned completing technical tasks.  One practical exam I took was eLearn Security's Certified Professional Penetration Tester in which I was given VPN access to a test environment that I logged into from home and had to hack my way through multiple networks and boxes and write a 30 page report over a few days.

Lastly, some certifications are vendor neutral or vendor specific.  Vendor neutral certifications are valuable because they demonstrate a broad knowledge whereas vendor specific certifications evidence you knowledge on specific software or hardware.  The marketability of these certs depend on the popularity of the software a company might use.  The Certified Cisco Network Associate (CCNA) will demonstrate your knowledge of networking and Cisco equipment, but won't be very useful if you work at a company that uses HP networking gear or is fully cloud.  However, completing the CompTIA Network+ certification is more broadly applicable, but won't only gets you part of the way there if you ever have to configure a Cisco router.  Both have their value but I find that vendor neutral certifications are generally more marketable.  

>[!warning] Warning - Certifications don't guarantee jobs
>Getting a job in the security field is a complex balance of many factors.  No one thing broadly qualifies an individual least of which guarantees a job.  Certifications are great but can also be offset with demonstratable experience or other factors.  Everyone's journey is different, but the more you do that you can show, the more doors that will open.  

The following list are a few certifications I generally recommend for security professionals starting out in their career.

**CompTIA Security+** - This certification is well recognized, affordable, and achievable.  It covers a wide range of security disciplines at a high level and is vendor agnostic.  I recommend Darrel Gibson's Security+ book and practice questions.  To get this cert, you need to read the book (I mean really read it and understand every sentence), do the practice questions, and take the test.  Don't draw it out or over think it.  You should start and finish in a month or two.  Anything more and you are not giving it enough focus.  I almost always recommend this certification to students and mentees as it will expose them to a generalized and wide range of topics while adding career value.  It also exposes learners to the wide range of security disciplines and can help identify what sub-field they may want to specialize in.  https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security

**INE Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)** - This course and exam is a practical and hands-on.  You will learn from video and text content then apply that knowledge in practical labs.  The three day exam requires you to hack into networks and boxes to demonstrate your knowledge.  Most people finish the exam in a matter of hours.  Most people I know, including myself, that have taken the exam are sad when it is over because you have so much fun during it.  It is a great course for entry level practical hacking.  If you are reading this, that means you are ready to take it on.  https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/

**ISC2 Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)** - Not for beginners, this certification requires 5 years experience in the field.  However, it is the most recognized cybersecurity certification out there.  It opens a lot of doors and opportunities.  This certification is non-technical and focuses more on management of cybersecurity scenarios.  I can't recommend how to prepare for it as the questions in the exam are not based on any textbook.  They require foundational knowledge and critical thinking.  Feels like every question is designed to trick you and can be very difficult.  I don't know how I passed, but I won't ever let it go.  https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cissp
